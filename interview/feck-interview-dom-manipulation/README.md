# Flickr Front End Interview Exercise: DOM Manipulation

A short exercise to test a candidate's DOM manipulation. Should take about 15 minutes.

## Tasks

1. Implement the `addBox` function to add a box to the list of boxes.
2. Implement the `removeBox` function to remove the last box from the list of boxes.
3. Implement the `addBoxes` function to add the number of boxes passed into the function to the end of the list.

## Notes

* Keep it as simple as possible
* Plain JavaScript only. No libraries. ES6/7 is fine if your browser supports it. Feel free to look up documentations.
* No need to make changes to the HTML or CSS
